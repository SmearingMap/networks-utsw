Leigh, Mike T., Mike P., and Cooper presented pitches for topics of interest.

## Topic Pitches


**Mike P:**: *Networks for enhancement of drug side effect prediction*.  Nonparametric statistical models are often used with varying degrees of success to predict side effects of drugs.  Can we use knowledge of underlying biological networks to infer the mechanism of side effects by seeing if features correspond to common pathways?h  

**Mike T.**: *Coarse-graining and compression of networks*.  How can we discover and eliminate redundant or otherwise irrelvant information to simplify network models to 1) make them more mathematically tractible 2) make them easier to understand and more intuitive?  Are there general principles for doing this? An example application is improvement in the interpretability of nonparametric (machine learning) models.

**Cooper**: *Network resilience to perturbations other than edge and node removal*.  What features of networks make them resilient to perturbations, specifically perturbations other than deletion?  Can we predict from network features which nodes/edges the network will tolerate perturbation to?  Can networks be modified to make them more robust, and at what cost, if any, can this be done?

**Leigh**: *Molecular structure networks*.  How much about molecular function can we learn from studying the network topology of proteins, specifically allosteric function?  Are there specific network properties that are constrained by natrual selection, e.g. the shortest path length between allosteric sites?

## Points of discussion

### Scientific

When is there an advantage to using network models as opposed to conventional multivariate statistics?
*Mike T comment:* The advantage is clearest when *network topology* is more important for understanding system behavior than the precise values of the parameters themselves.  A good example of this is [Uri Alon's work on network motifs](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824).

### Procedural

**Graph theory preliminaries** We floated the idea of a graph theory tutorial for the next session, but decided against it.  Interested members can review [Newman (2003)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0303516) and [Barabasi and Albert (2002)](http://barabasi.com/f/103.pdf) for reviews of definitions.  However, the group will strive to be as self-contained as possible.  We will introduce terminology as needed; members should only need to know what nodes and edges are.  I (Mike T.) may post short tutorials on Github introducing concepts as needed; all others are welcome to do so as well.

### Next meeting

Our next meeting will be on August 22 from 11-12 in the Green Center conference room.

Cooper's pitch on resilience was agreed upon as generally interesting.  Members agreed to search for papers related to this topic to submit to the group as early as possible.  By Monday, we should all have skimmed papers and will take a vote on which paper to to discuss on the 22.
